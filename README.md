# Would You Rather App

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5def95fb-5afa-4948-a41c-6d19048e5499/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ndwouldyourather/deploys)

This is the second project of three in Udacity's [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). This web app lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
